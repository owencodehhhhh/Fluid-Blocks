# Fluid-Blocks
This is a Fluid Blocks addon
It is heavily inspired by Pheonixsc's "I made every block flow like water" video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLz1PaukBbQ&t=16s
it is basically the same except you can still place the orginal blocks and you still have normal looking water and each block has its own bucket
